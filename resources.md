### Description
 The Index of Asian American and Pacific Islander Artists (IAAPI) is a research aid for identifying publications in Watsonline, the online catalog of the Metropolitan Museum of Art libraries, by and about artists of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage who have lived, worked, and studied in North America, primarily the United States. Inclusion in the Index indicates that an artist's name appears in one or more Watsonline records: the extent to which each artist is represented ranges from a single entry in an encyclopedia or biographical dictionary to more than one hundred titles.
